<P CLASS="poem">
The eager night and the impetuous winds,<BR>
The hints and whispers of a thousand lures,<BR>
And all the swift persuasion of the Spring<BR>
Surged from the stars and stones, and swept me on...<BR>
The smell of honeysuckles, keen and clear,<BR>
Startled and shook me, with the sudden thrill<BR>
Of some well-known but half-forgotten voice.<BR>
A slender stream became a naked sprite,<BR>
Flashed around curious bends, and winked at me<BR>
Beyond the turns, alert and mischievous.<BR>
A saffron moon, dangling among the trees,<BR>
Seemed like a toy balloon caught in the boughs,<BR>
Flung there in sport by some too-mirthful breeze...<BR>
And as it hung there, vivid and unreal,<BR>
The whole world's lethargy was brushed away;<BR>
The night kept tugging at my torpid mood<BR>
And tore it into shreds.  A warm air blew<BR>
My wintry slothfulness beyond the stars;<BR>
And over all indifference there streamed<BR>
A myriad urges in one rushing wave...<BR>
Touched with the lavish miracles of earth,<BR>
I felt the brave persistence of the grass;<BR>
The far desire of rivulets; the keen,<BR>
Unconquerable fervor of the thrush;<BR>
The endless labors of the patient worm;<BR>
The lichen's strength; the prowess of the ant;<BR>
The constancy of flowers; the blind belief<BR>
Of ivy climbing slowly toward the sun;<BR>
The eternal struggles and eternal deaths&mdash;<BR>
And yet the groping faith of every root!<BR>
Out of old graves arose the cry of life;<BR>
Out of the dying came the deathless call.<BR>
And, thrilling with a new sweet restlessness,<BR>
The thing that was my boyhood woke in me&mdash;<BR>
Dear, foolish fragments made me strong again;<BR>
Valiant adventures, dreams of those to come,<BR>
And all the vague, heroic hopes of youth,<BR>
With fresh abandon, like a fearless laugh,<BR>
Leaped up to face the heaven's unconcern...<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And then&mdash;veil upon veil was torn aside&mdash;<BR>
Stars, like a host of merry girls and boys,<BR>
Danced gaily 'round me, plucking at my hand;<BR>
The night, scorning its ancient mystery,<BR>
Leaned down and pressed new courage in my heart;<BR>
The hermit thrush, throbbing with more than Song,<BR>
Sang with a happy challenge to the skies;<BR>
Love, and the faces of a world of children,<BR>
Swept like a conquering army through my blood&mdash;<BR>
And Beauty, rising out of all its forms,<BR>
Beauty, the passion of the universe,<BR>
Flamed with its joy, a thing too great for tears.<BR>
And, like a wine, poured itself out for me<BR>
To drink of, to be warmed with, and to go<BR>
Refreshed and strengthened to the ceaseless fight;<BR>
To meet with confidence the cynic years;<BR>
Battling in wars that never can be won,<BR>
Seeking the lost cause and the brave defeat!<BR>

THE GREAT CAROUSAL<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, do not think me dead when I<BR>
Beneath a bit of earth shall lie;<BR>
Think not that aught can ever kill<BR>
My arrogant and stubborn will.<BR>
My buoyant strength, my eager soul,<BR>
My stern desire shall keep me whole<BR>
And lift me from the drowsy deep...<BR>
I shall not even yield to Sleep,<BR>
For Death can never take from me<BR>
My warm, insatiate energy;<BR>
He shall not dare to touch one part<BR>
Of the gay challenge of my heart.<BR>
And I shall laugh at him, and lie<BR>
Happy beneath a laughing sky;<BR>
For I have fought too joyously<BR>
To let the conqueror conquer me&mdash;<BR>
I know that, after strengthening strife,<BR>
Death cannot quench my love of life;<BR>
Rob me of my dear self, my ears<BR>
Of music or my eyes of tears ...<BR>
No, Death shall come in friendlier guise;<BR>
The cloths of darkness from my eyes<BR>
He shall roll back, and lo, the sea<BR>
Of Silence shall not cover me.<BR>
He shall make soft my final bed,<BR>
Stand, like a servant, at my head;<BR>
And, thrilled with all that Death may give,<BR>
I shall lie down to rest&mdash;and live...<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And I shall know within the earth<BR>
A softer but a deeper mirth.<BR>
The wind shall never troll a song<BR>
But I shall hear it borne along,<BR>
And echoed long before he passes<BR>
By all the little unborn grasses.<BR>
I shall be clasped by roots and rains,<BR>
Feeding and fed by living grains;<BR>
There shall not be a single flower<BR>
Above my head but bears my power,<BR>
And every butterfly or bee<BR>
That tastes the flower shall drink of me.<BR>
Ah, we shall share a lip to lip<BR>
Carousal and companionship!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The storm, like some great blustering lout,<BR>
Shall play his games with me and shout<BR>
His joy to all the country-side.<BR>
Autumn, sun-tanned and April-eyed,<BR>
Shall scamper by and send his hosts<BR>
Of leaves, like brown and merry ghosts,<BR>
To frolic over me; and stones<BR>
Shall feel the dancing in their bones.<BR>
And red-cheeked Winter too shall be<BR>
A jovial bed-fellow for me,<BR>
Setting the startled hours ringing<BR>
With boisterous tales and lusty singing.<BR>
And, like a mother that has smiled<BR>
For years on every tired child,<BR>
Summer shall hold me in her lap...<BR>
And when the root stirs and the sap<BR>
Climbs anxiously beyond the boughs,<BR>
And all the friendly worms carouse,<BR>
Then, oh, how proudly, we shall sing<BR>
Bravuras for the feet of Spring!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And I shall lie forever there<BR>
Like some great king, and watch the fair<BR>
Young Spring dance on for me, and know<BR>
That love and rosy valleys glow<BR>
Where'er her blithe feet touch the earth.<BR>
And headlong joy and reckless mirth<BR>
Seeing her footsteps shall pursue.<BR>
Oh, I shall watch her smile and strew<BR>
Laughter and life with either hand;<BR>
And every quiver of the land,<BR>
Shall pierce me, while a joyful wave<BR>
Beats in upon my radiant grave.<BR>
Aye, like a king in deathless state<BR>
I shall be throned, and contemplate<BR>
The dying of the years, the vast<BR>
Vague panorama of the past,<BR>
The march of centuries, the surge<BR>
Of ages .... but the deathless urge<BR>
Shall stir me always, and my will<BR>
Shall laugh to keep me living still;<BR>
Thrilling with every call and cry&mdash;<BR>
Too much in love with life to die.<BR>
Content to touch the earth, to hear<BR>
The whisper of each waiting year,<BR>
To help the stars go proudly by,<BR>
To speed the timid grass; and lie,<BR>
Sharing, with every movement's breath,<BR>
The rich eternity of Death.<BR>

GOD'S YOUTH<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
I often wish that I had been alive<BR>
Ere God grew old, before His eyes were tired<BR>
Of the eternal circlings of the sun;<BR>
Of the perpetual Springs; the weary years<BR>
Forever marching on an unknown quest;<BR>
The yawning seasons pacing to and fro,<BR>
Like stolid sentinels to guard the earth.<BR>
I wish that I had been alive when He<BR>
Was still delighted with each casual thing<BR>
His mind could fashion, when His soul first thrilled<BR>
With childlike pleasure at the blooming sun;<BR>
When the first dawn met His enraptured eyes,<BR>
And the first prayers of men stirred in His heart.<BR>
With what a glow of pride He heard the stars<BR>
Rush by Him singing as they bravely leaped<BR>
Into the unexplored and endless skies,<BR>
Bearing His beauty, like a battle-cry.<BR>
Or watched the light, obedient to His will,<BR>
Spring out of nothingness to answer Him,<BR>
Hurling strange suns and planets in its joy<BR>
Of fiery freedom from the lifeless dark.<BR>
But more than all the splendid heavens He made,<BR>
The elements new-tamed, the harnessed worlds;<BR>
In spite of these, it must have pleased Him most<BR>
To feel Himself branch out, let go, dare all,<BR>
Give utterance to His vaguely-formed desires,<BR>
And loose a flood of fancies, wild and frank.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh those were noble times; those gay attempts,<BR>
Those vast and droll experiments that were made<BR>
When God was young and blithe and whimsical.<BR>
When, from the infinite humor of His heart,<BR>
He made the elk with such extravagant horns,<BR>
The grotesque monkey-folk, the angel-fish,<BR>
That make the ocean's depths a visual heaven;<BR>
The animals like plants, the plants like beasts;<BR>
The loud, inane hyena, and the great<BR>
Impossible giraffe, whose silly head<BR>
Threatens the stars, his feet embracing earth.<BR>
The paradox of the peacock, whose bright form<BR>
Is like a brilliant trumpet, and his voice<BR>
A strident squawk, a cackle and a joke.<BR>
The ostrich, like a snake tied to a bird,<BR>
All out of sense and drawing, wilder far<BR>
Than all the mad, fantastic thoughts of men.<BR>
The hump-backed camel, like a lump of clay,<BR>
Thumbed at for hours, and then thrown aside.<BR>
The elephant, with splendid, useless tooth,<BR>
And nose and arm and fingers all in one.<BR>
The hippopotamus, absurd and bland&mdash;<BR>
Oh, how God must have laughed when first He saw<BR>
These great jests breathe and love and walk about;<BR>
And how the heavens must have echoed him...<BR>
For greater than His beauty or His wrath<BR>
Was God's vast mirth before His back was bent<BR>
With Time and all the troubling universe,<BR>
Ere He grew dull and weary with creating...<BR>
Oh, to have been alive and heard that laugh<BR>
Thrilling the stars, convulsing all the earth,<BR>
While meteors flashed from out His sparkling eyes,<BR>
And even the eternal, placid Night<BR>
Forgot to lift reproving fingers, smiled<BR>
And joined, indulgent, in the merriment...<BR>
And, how they sang, and how the hours flew<BR>
When God was young and blithe and whimsical.<BR>

SUNDAY<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
It was Sunday&mdash;<BR>
Eleven in the morning; people were at church&mdash;<BR>
Prayers were in the making; God was near at hand&mdash;<BR>
Down the cramped and narrow streets of quiet Lawrence<BR>
Came the tramp of workers marching in their hundreds;<BR>
Marching in the morning, marching to the grave-yard,<BR>
Where, no longer fiery, underneath the grasses,<BR>
Callous and uncaring, lay their friend and sister.<BR>
In their hands they carried wreaths and drooping flowers,<BR>
Overhead their banners dipped and soared like eagles&mdash;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Aye, but eagles bleeding, stained with their own heart's-blood&mdash;<BR>
Red, but not for glory&mdash;red, with wounds and travail,<BR>
Red, the buoyant symbol of the blood of all the world...<BR>
So they bore their banners, singing toward the grave-yard,<BR>
So they marched and chanted, mingling tears and tributes,<BR>
So, with flowers, the dying went to deck the dead.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Within the churches people heard<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The sound, and much concern was theirs&mdash;</SPAN><BR>
God might not hear the Sacred Word&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">God might not hear their prayers!</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Should such things be allowed these slaves&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">To vex the Sabbath peace with Song,</SPAN><BR>

<I>Suppose God turned to these&mdash;and heard!<BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The blue-clad Guardians of the Peace</SPAN><BR>

</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
To scatter those who came and vexed<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">God with their troubled cries and cares.</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Up the rapt and singing streets of little Lawrence,<BR>
Came the stolid soldiers; and, behind the blue-coats,<BR>
Grinning and invisible, bearing unseen torches,<BR>
Rode red hordes of anger, sweeping all before them.<BR>
Lust and Evil joined them&mdash;Terror rode among them;<BR>
Fury fired its pistols; Madness stabbed and yelled...<BR>
Through the wild and bleeding streets of shuddering Lawrence,<BR>
Raged the heedless panic, hour-long and bitter.<BR>
Passion tore and trampled; men once mild and peaceful,<BR>
Fought with savage hatred in the name of Law and Order.<BR>
And, below the outcry, like the sea beneath the breakers,<BR>
Mingling with the anguish, rolled the solemn organ...<BR>

He ceased; a sudden radiance round him shone,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And all things melted like a phantom wrack.</SPAN><BR>
And as he swept his hands and stood alone<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">He heard hoarse thunders and the dusk grew black.</SPAN><BR>
Vast tremors shook the world from side to side&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The earth and sky became a monstrous blot...</SPAN><BR>

When Life's gay courage fails at last,<BR>

Though Death puts out my fiery heart,<BR>

For warm is earth's green covering,<BR>

Wrapped in the winding-sheets of air<BR>

Something impelled her from the hearth;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Whispers and winds drew her along;</SPAN><BR>
But still, unconscious of the earth,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">She read her book of golden Song.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Old legends stirred her as she read<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Of life victoriously unfurled,</SPAN><BR>
Of glories gone but never dead,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And Beauty that redeemed the world.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Oh Songs," she sighed, "your world was fair;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">My own holds no such lovely things;</SPAN><BR>
No glow, no magic anywhere&mdash;"<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And then, a start&mdash;a flash of wings...</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And, with the rush of surging seas,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Over her swept the world's replies:</SPAN><BR>
The lyric hills, the buoyant breeze<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And all the sudden singing skies!</SPAN><BR>
